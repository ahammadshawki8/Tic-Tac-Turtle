# Tick-Tac-Turtle
A Tick-Tac-Toe game which is made by @ahammadshawki8 and @Arko07-quanta. You need to play this game in the Python shell. We have added Graphics and turtle visulization in Version 2.0. But unfortunately Version 2.0 doesn't supports SmartPhones. So, if you want to play this game using your mobile, you are in the right place. We hope to add interectivity in the upcoming versions.

For Graphics and Turtle visulization you can try [version 2.0](https://github.com/ahammadshawki8/Tick-Tac-Turtle/tree/master). Remember, Version 2.0 doesn't supports SmartPhones.
